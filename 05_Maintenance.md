Step 5 in Green Software Development is optimizing application maintenance

# Overview

Optimizing application maintenance involves continuous monitoring, updating, and refining software to sustain its energy efficiency and reduce its environmental impact.

## 5.1 Keep your workload up to date:

Keeping your operating systems, libraries, and applications Up-to-date improves workload efficiency and enables easier adoption of more efficient technologies. Up-to-date software may also include features that help measure the sustainability impact of your workload more accurately.

## 5.2 Regular Performance Audits:

Periodically review your workload against the sustainability best practices to identify targets for improvements. 

Use AWS Cost and Usage Reports (CUR) and AWS Customer Carbon Footprint Tool (CCFT) to identify hot spots that you can target to improve resource utilization and/or reduce the resource required to complete a unit of work. 

### Using AWS Cost and Usage Reports (CUR) 

It is a comprehensive tool that provides detailed insights into your AWS spending and usage patterns. It allows you to monitor and analyze costs across different AWS services, helping you make informed decisions to optimize your cloud expenditure. 

**Installation of AWS Cost and Usage Reports**
1. Navigate to AWS Management Console: Go to the AWS Billing and Cost Management Console.
2. Access Reports Section: Click on "Cost & Usage Reports" under the "Cost Management" section.
3. Create a New Report: Click on "Create report" and provide a name for your report.
4. Configure Report Content: Select the data fields you want to include in your report, such as cost allocation tags, and specify how the data should be aggregated.
5. Set Report Preferences: Choose the time granularity (hourly, daily, or monthly) and the data format (CSV or Parquet).
6. Define S3 Bucket for Report Storage: Specify an S3 bucket where the report will be stored. Ensure you have proper permissions set for the bucket.
7. Review and Complete Setup: Review your report settings and click "Create report" to finalize.

For more detailed instructions, refer to the official AWS Cost and Usage Reports User Guide.

### Using AWS Customer Carbon Footprint Tool (CCFT)

It is a specialized utility provided by Amazon Web Services to help users understand and manage the carbon emissions associated with their AWS usage. It provides insights into the environmental impact of cloud operations, offering detailed reports on carbon emissions and aiding organizations in making more sustainable choices in their cloud infrastructure.

**Installation of AWS Customer Carbon Footprint Tool (CCFT)**
1. Log in to AWS Management Console: Go to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to Billing and Cost Management: Find the tool under the "Billing and Cost Management" section.
3. Enable Access: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to view billing and usage reports.

For more information on setting up permissions, check the AWS IAM documentation.

While implementing improvements, identify metrics that can help to quantify the impact of improvement on associated resources (compute, storage, network resources etc.) provisioned for workload being reviewed. In scenarios when you don’t have direct metrics to help track specific improvement or it can be complex and costly to setup, you can rely on Proxy metrics to monitor and analyze the efficiency of a system or workload.

## 5.3 Monitor Code size & Efficiency:

Review your code for code smells (unused code block that can be removed, duplicate code blocks that can be refactored to common function, unused variable declarations that can be removed, memory leaks, loops, switch statements etc.) and remove them to reduce the overall execution for each request which invokes that code. 

## Performing Code Smell Detection
Code smells are indicators of possible issues within your code that may not be outright bugs but suggest problems that could lead to more significant issues down the line. They are often subtle signs of inefficiencies, poor design choices, or violations of best coding practices. Common examples include duplicated code, large classes, long methods, and complex conditional logic.  

### Tools for Code Smell Detection

**1. SonarQube**

**Description**

SonarQube is an open-source platform that continuously inspects the quality of code and identifies code smells, bugs, and security vulnerabilities. It supports various programming languages and integrates well with CI/CD pipelines, making it a popular choice for continuous code quality monitoring.

**Installation & Usage**

1. Download SonarQube from SonarQube Downloads.
2. Install and Run the server by following the installation guide.
3. Integrate with your project using SonarQube scanners for your preferred language or build tool. Detailed steps are available in the official documentation.

**2. Checkstyle**

**Description**

Checkstyle is a development tool that helps programmers adhere to coding standards by analyzing code for stylistic errors and code smells. It’s particularly useful for enforcing a consistent code style in Java projects.

**Installation & Usage**

1. Download Checkstyle from the Checkstyle releases page.
2. Integrate Checkstyle with your project by adding it to your build tool (e.g., Maven or Gradle) as described in the installation guide.
3. Run Checkstyle using the command line or IDE plugins. Follow the usage instructions for detailed steps.

## 5.4 Define Improvement process:

Sustainability improvement is a cyclic process and not a one time journey. Use Well-Architected for sustainability to identify area of improvement, define an improvement plan, implement and test improvement, and if successful plan for sharing your learnings with other project teams. Refer to Improvement process for more details.
