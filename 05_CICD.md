## GREEN DEVOPS AND TESTING:
Green DevOps is a concept that combines the principles of DevOps with a focus on sustainability, incorporating practices that minimise the environmental impact of software development and deployment processes.

## BENEFITS
- Reduced energy consumption
- Improved resource efficiency
- Enhanced software quality

## STRATEGIES:
1. Incremental Builds: Only rebuild what's necessary, rather than rebuilding the entire project.
2. Implement caching mechanisms: Cache intermediate build results to avoid redundant computations.
3. Optimize pipeline execution order: Execute tasks in a minimizes dependencies and reduces unnecessary rebuilds.
4. Use energy-efficient CI/CD tools: Choose tools with low energy footprints, such as Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD.
5. Configure tool settings for efficiency: Optimize tool settings to reduce energy consumption, such as setting timeouts or idle periods.
