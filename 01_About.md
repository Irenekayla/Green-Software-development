Step 1: Understanding Green Software Development

# **Overview**

- What is green software development?
- What is the environmental impact of traditional software practices?
- What is the goal of green software development?

## **1.1 What Is Green Software Development?**

### **Imagine Writing Code That Helps Save the Planet:**
Green software development is all about creating software that’s not just smart, but also environmentally friendly. It’s like turning your coding superpowers into a force for good, ensuring that your software makes a minimal impact on the planet.

### **Key Ideas :**

- Energy-Efficient Code: Think of your code as a hybrid car. Just like a hybrid uses less fuel, energy-efficient code uses less electricity. For example, an app that quickly performs calculations without wasting power is like a car that gets great mileage.
- Resource Optimization: Imagine you’re packing a suitcase. Instead of throwing everything in, you carefully fold and organize to fit the most in the least space. Similarly, optimized software uses resources like CPU and memory efficiently, ensuring that nothing is wasted.
- Eco-Friendly Design: Picture building a house with solar panels and energy-efficient appliances. In software, this means designing apps that run well on energy-efficient hardware and don’t require constant updates that eat up resources.
