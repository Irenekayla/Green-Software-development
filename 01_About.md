Step 1: Understanding Green Software Development

# **Overview**

- What is green software development?
- What is the environmental impact of traditional software practices?
- What is the goal of green software development?
- What is Sustainable Software Development Life Cycle (S-SDLC)?


## **1.1 What Is Green Software Development?**

### **Imagine Writing Code That Helps Save the Planet:**
Green software development is all about creating software that’s not just smart, but also environmentally friendly. It’s like turning your coding superpowers into a force for good, ensuring that your software makes a minimal impact on the planet.

### **Key Ideas :**

- Energy-Efficient Code: Think of your code as a hybrid car. Just like a hybrid uses less fuel, energy-efficient code uses less electricity. For example, an app that quickly performs calculations without wasting power is like a car that gets great mileage.

- Resource Optimization: Imagine you’re packing a suitcase. Instead of throwing everything in, you carefully fold and organize to fit the most in the least space. Similarly, optimized software uses resources like CPU and memory efficiently, ensuring that nothing is wasted.

- Eco-Friendly Design: Picture building a house with solar panels and energy-efficient appliances. In software, this means designing apps that run well on energy-efficient hardware and don’t require constant updates that eat up resources.

## **1.2 What is the environmental impact of traditional software practices ?**
Traditional software practices contribute to environmental degradation through high energy consumption in data centers and devices, significant carbon emissions, and the generation of electronic waste from frequent device turnover due to software updates.

### **1.2.1 Environmental Impact Categories :**

1. High Energy Consumption:

- Data centers and computing devices consume substantial amounts of energy, primarily from fossil fuels.
- This contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.
  
2. Carbon Emissions:

- Operations like data centers and device manufacturing release carbon dioxide (CO2) and other pollutants.
- emissions worsen environmental degradation and global warming.
  
3. Electronic Waste Generation:

- Software updates often lead to device obsolescence, resulting in large quantities of electronic waste (e-waste).
- Improper disposal of e-waste poses environmental and health risks.

### **1.2.2 Notable Environmental Case Studies :**

1. In 2018, video streaming generated as much greenhouse gas emissions as the whole of Spain.

2. YouTube views of the song “Despacito” consumed the same amount of electricity as five African countries in one year.

3. Training a single natural language processing model produces as much CO2 as 315 return flights from New York to San Francisco.

## 1.3 Why Develop Green Software? 

The answer lies in the two philosophies of sustainable software:

1. Everyone Has a Role in Fighting Global Warming and Climate Change : We are all connected. To achieve our climate goals on a global scale, we need as many hands on deck as possible plus cross-disciplinary cooperation across industries and within engineering itself.

2. Sustainability Alone Is Enough to Make Your Efforts Worthwhile : Sustainable software applications are often cheaper, better-performing, and more resilient than their conventional counterparts. However, the main reason to invest in green technologies should be sustainability itself. Everything else is just a bonus.

## 1.4 The Benefits of Green Software 

In addition to the environmental benefits, there is a strong business case for green software engineering. Some of its advantages include:

- Simpler architecture. Sustainable application architecture has fewer interdependencies. As a result, green software systems tend to be more straightforward and energy-efficient.
  
- Faster computing speed. Simpler systems make for faster software.
Low resource usage. Green systems use fewer resources, which translates into long-term cost savings.

- Brand resilience. Consumers today care about the integrity and social responsibility of their service providers. By raising awareness about environmental issues and reducing your carbon footprint through green software development, you can foster brand loyalty and resilience.

## 1.5 What is Sustainable Software Development Life Cycle (S-SDLC)?

The goal of sustainability in software development life cycle would focus on ensuring responsible application design, development and maintenance keeping energy consumption in mind. You should focus on increasing utilization for spun-up resources and reducing/removing idle resources. Sustainable Software Development Life Cycle (S-SDLC) is not so much about doing different things as it is about considering sustainability in doing things.

These are the key tenants and principles that are considered in S-SDLC.

- Share learning experiences and create a sustainability mindset across SDLC
- Leverage automation capabilities wherever possible
- Establish measurements to gain insights and create learning opportunities
- Makes sustainability a continuous focus including all stakeholders in the sustainability considerations
- Sustainability is everyone’s responsibility
- Focus on increasing utilization and minimizing waste
- Use efficient resources for your workload and focus on business differentiators while offloading undifferentiated heavy lifting to cloud
